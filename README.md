# CS-1390 Final Project

# Requirements
- [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) (TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning)
- [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) (Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks.)
- [pickle](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.10/Lib/pickle.py) (The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure.)
- [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) (NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.)

# In a Nutshell   
Here is how you can use this project to generate a caption for an image:
- Add an image of your choice to the top level directory and name it `test.jpg`.
- In `IML_CaptionGenerator.ipynb`, run the 'Import Tensorflow and Keras' block.
- In `IML_CaptionGenerator.ipynb`, run the 'Caption Generation' block. This will print the generated caption for `test.jpg`. You can test a different model by specifying it here.
``` 
model = load_model('model/model_11.h5')
```
